                     <h4>Brigadier. Suhail Abbas S.I. (M)</h4>
                     <p>Cantt Public School and College has brought out its first magazine. Since I have assumed the charge of President Cantonment Board this is yet, another major achievement. Our system, has been providing educational facilities through its dynamics approach focusing on core values of honesty, loyalty, perseverance, and compassion. Our students include wards of Cantonment Board Malir employees, residents of Malir Cantt and many others whom we consider an asset to be polished and groomed. Our goal is to impart quality education and “Education is not the learning of facts, but the training of the mind to think” (Albert Einstein). Any Institution’s magazine is a true reflection of the culture and attainments of the institution. A magazine showcases the talent, creativity and intellectual excellence of the staff and student. It satisfies the instincts of self – actualization and self-accomplishment among the perspective writers, poets, thinkers and scholars of tomorrow. In the last I would like to express my pleasure and compliment all those who have contributed to this milestone achievement. I am sure they will continue to work with the same zeal and effort leading to an ever – improved education system in the future as well. May Allah bless us with a crowning success in all our endeavours. Ameen.</p>

                     <h4>Mr. Arfeen Zubair Chaudhry</h4>
                     <p>Education is a key that unlocks the creative impulses within human beings and I would say it emphatically, that education is the process of empowering individuals and educational institutions are the agents of this empowerment. Our mission is to strive for excellence and to give quality education to all our students . Collectively, we are committed that every student has equal access to educational opportunities irrespective of their background or circumstances. It is with great pleasure that I congratulate Cantt Public School & College Malir Cantt on the successful publication of first ever magazine named 'Reflections'. I would also like to extend appreciation to all those who have contributed in this project. This magazine will not only be a source of pride for our school, but also a reflection of the incredible passion and talent that make up our school’s community.</p>

                     <p>It is my pride and privilege to be the Principal of Cantt Public School & College Malir Cantt Karachi. In addition to the numerous achievements of the institution "Reflections" is yet another milestone. An institution magazine reflects the identity of an educational institution and has a great educative value. It is a forum which encourages students to think, write and express themselves on different issues.
                        We have faith in our students and we believe that with an optimistic approach we can bring forth the best and reach the pinnacle of perfection in whatever task we undertake. In our institution, every student is considered unique whose talent potential is groomed in consonance with our vision that "we give dream to every child.
